                            If you're in a dodgy area, Safer Streets will let you know so you can take control of your own wellbeing. The Safer Streets technology analyzes crime and safety related information daily to help you make informed decisions about your wellbeing.</p>

Safer Streets is a labor of love, built by a team who believes that technology has been underutilized in helping women feel safer. We hope to change that.
